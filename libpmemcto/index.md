#### The libpmemcto library

**libpmemcto** was an experimental API that has been discontinued.  The
API never fully worked correctly and most use cases are better covered
by either [libpmemobj](../libpmemobj) (for persistent use cases) or [libmemkind](https://github.com/memkind/memkind)
(for volatile use cases).
