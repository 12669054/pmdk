.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[] invoked with \f[C]check\f[] command checks
consistency of a given pool file.
If the pool file is consistent \f[B]pmempool\f[] exits with 0 value.
If the pool file is not consistent non\-zero error code is returned.
.PP
In case of any errors, the proper message is printed.
The verbosity level may be increased using \f[C]\-v\f[] option.
The output messages may be also suppressed using \f[C]\-q\f[] option.
