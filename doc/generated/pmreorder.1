store reordering mechanism

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The pmreorder tool is a collection of python scripts designed to parse
and replay operations logged by pmemcheck \- a persistent memory
checking tool.
.PP
Pmreorder performs the store reordering between persistent memory
barriers \- a sequence of flush\-fence operations.
It uses a consistency checking routine provided in the command line
options to check whether files are in a consistent state.
.PP
Considering that logging, replaying and reordering of operations is very
time consuming, it is recommended to use as few stores as possible in
test workloads.
.PP
\f[B]pmreorder\f[] core functionality is still under construction.
Please expect man page update soon.
