.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]pmempool\-transform\f[] \-\- Modify internal structure of a
poolset.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pmempool\ transform\ [options]\ <poolset_file_src>\ <poolset_file_dst>
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool transform\f[] command modifies internal structure of a
poolset defined by the \f[C]poolset_file_src\f[] file, according to a
structure described in the \f[C]poolset_file_dst\f[] file.
.PP
The following operations are supported:
.IP \[bu] 2
adding replicas \- a new replica can be added and synchronized with
other replicas in the poolset,
.IP \[bu] 2
removing replicas \- replicas can be removed from the poolset.
.PP
Currently these operations are allowed only for \f[B]pmemobj\f[] pools
(see \f[B]libpmemobj\f[](3)).
.PP
The \f[I]poolset_file_src\f[] argument provides the source poolset to be
changed.
.PP
The \f[I]poolset_file_dst\f[] argument points to the target poolset.
.PP
When adding or deleting replica, the two poolset files can differ only
in the definitions of replicas which are to be added or deleted.
Also, to add a replica it is necessary for its size to match or exceed
the poolset size.
Otherwise the whole operation fails and no changes are applied.
.SS Available options:
.TP
.B \f[C]\-d,\ \-\-dry\-run\f[]
Enable dry run mode.
In this mode no changes are applied, only check for viability of the
operation is performed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]\-h,\ \-\-help\f[]
Display help message and exit.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Example 1.
.PP
Let us assume that files \f[C]/poolset_file_src\f[] and
\f[C]/poolset_file_dst\f[] have the following contents, respectively:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
20M\ /0/partfile2
21M\ /0/partfile3
REPLICA
40M\ /1/partfile1
20M\ /1/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
40M\ /0/partfile4
21M\ /0/partfile3
REPLICA
30M\ /1/partfile3
30M\ /1/partfile4
REPLICA
50M\ /2/partfile1
20M\ /2/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then, the command
.PP
\f[C]pmempool\ transform\ /poolset_file_src\ /poolset_file_dst\f[]
.PP
yields the following:
.IP \[bu] 2
The first two parts of the master replica are joined into one large
part.
The third part of the replica remains unchanged.
.IP \[bu] 2
The first regular replica\[aq]s structure will change from two parts of
size 40M and 20M to two parts of size 30M and 30M.
.IP \[bu] 2
The second regular replica consisting of two parts will be created.
The size of the new replica is 70M, but the size of the pool remains
60M.
.SS Example 2.
.PP
Now, let \f[C]/poolset_file_src\f[] and \f[C]/poolset_file_dst\f[] have
the following contents, respectively:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
50M\ /0/partfile2
REPLICA
40M\ /1/partfile1
20M\ /1/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PMEMPOOLSET
20M\ /0/partfile1
50M\ /0/partfile2
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Then
.PP
\f[C]pmempool_transform\ "/poolset_file_src"\ "/poolset_file_dst");\f[]
.PP
deletes the second replica from the poolset.
The second replica remains unchanged and the size of the pool remains(!)
60M.
