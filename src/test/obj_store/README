This is src/test/obj_store/README.

This directory contains unit tests for object store functions.

The program in obj_store.c takes a file name and an operation encoded
by a character as arguments. For example:

	./obj_store file1 r

The following characters and operations can be used:
	r - root object functions:
		- pmemobj_root
		- pmemobj_root_size
	a - functions:
		- pmemobj_alloc
		- pmemobj_free
		- pmemobj_first
		- pmemobj_next
	f - foreach macros:
		- POBJ_FOREACH
		- POBJ_FOREACH_TYPE
		- POBJ_FOREACH_SAFE
	u - user list macros:
		- POBJ_LIST_INSERT_NEW_HEAD
		- POBJ_LIST_FOREACH
		- POBJ_LIST_FOREACH_REVERSE
