#### The libvmem library

**libvmem** supports the traditional _malloc_/_free_
interfaces on a memory mapped file.  This allows the
use of persistent memory as volatile memory, for cases
where the pool of persistent memory is useful to an
application, but when the application doesn't need
it to be persistent.

The [libvmem man page](libvmem.3.html) contains a list of the
interfaces provided.
