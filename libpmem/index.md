#### The libpmem library

**libpmem** provides low level persistent memory support.
In particular, support for the persistent memory instructions
for flushing changes to pmem is provided.

This library is provided for software which tracks every store
to pmem and needs to flush those changes to durability.  Most
developers will find higher level libraries like
[libpmemobj](../libpmemobj) to be much more convenient.

The [libpmem man page](libpmem.3.html) contains a list of the
interfaces provided.
