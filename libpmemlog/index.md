#### The libpmemlog library

**libpmemlog** implements a pmem-resident log file.

This library is provided for cases requiring an append-mostly
file to record variable length entries.  Most
developers will find higher level libraries like
[libpmemobj](../libpmemobj) to be more generally useful.

The [libpmemlog man page](libpmemlog.3.html) contains a list of the
interfaces provided.
