Linux NVM Library

This is benchmarks/mt/README.

This directory contains the multithreaded allocations benchmark.

mt benchmark serves as a comparison tool between any malloc library and libvmem,
it measures the number of malloc and free operations per second.

Benchmark run can be configured to use certain number of threads to allocate
given amount of memory.

By default, the makefile builds the application without linking to any
non-standard malloc libraries.

The application itself requires two arguments: thread count and
operations count. First, the benchmark performs mallocs in threads, then frees
the allocated memory. Time spent doing these operations is measured separately.
By default libvmem is used, to choose different allocator use '-e' option.
For more informations about the application usage invoke --help ('-?').

In order to compare libvmem against other allocators,
set LD_PRELOAD environment variable before running the benchmark.

For example, running this command before the benchmark:
export LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/path/to/jemalloc/libjemalloc.so
will allow you to measure the performance of jemalloc.

For convenience, there is a simple RUN.sh script provided that will compare
libvmem with provided library and generate results charts. To use it simply do:
./RUN.sh [malloc_library.so]

The results of the benchmark are printed to standard output, use provided
gnuplot scripts (gnuplot_mt_free.p, gnuplot_mt_malloc.p) to visualize them.

Output format:
total malloc operations time;malloc operations per second;
total free operations time;free operations per second;

See the top-level README for instructions on building the entire library.
