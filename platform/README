Linux NVM Library

This is platform/README.

This directory contains the platform-specific files for the NVM Library.

For each platform (i.e. "linux", "windows", etc.) there is a subdirectory
containing all the platform-specific source files, scripts, etc.

The structure of "*/src" subdirectories is the same as for "src"
subdirectory in the main directory of the NVML source tree.
